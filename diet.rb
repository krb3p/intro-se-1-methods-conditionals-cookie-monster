# Define your methods here

# 1. Define a method that returns the string "GET BACK ON YOUR DIET!" if Cookie Monster has eaten any cookies.
#    If he has eaten zero cookies, return the string "Good job, Cookie Monster."

def perfect_day(cookies)

end

# 2. Not every day can be a perfect day. Let's write a method for a good_day of dieting.
#    If Cookie has eaten fewer than three cookies, it should return a string that congratulates him.
#    If Cookie has eaten exactly three cookies, let's return a string telling him to stop now.
#    If Cookie has eaten more than three cookies, let's return a string scolding him for eating too many.



# 3. The longer Cookie is on this diet, the more we feel we can trust him. Let's write a flex_day method.
#    Let's write a method that takes in two arguments - a goal number of cookies and current number of cookies.
#    It will do the same as the previous method did, so calling flex_day(2, 3) should return a scolding string, since he ate one more than his goal.



# 4. CHALLENGE: Dieting isn't all about cutting out unhealthy foods; it's also about balance.
#    Let's define a method called balanced_diet that takes in two arguments - a number of cookies and a number of vegetables.
#    If Cookie has eaten more vegetables than he has cookies, congratulate him!
#    If Cookie has eaten the same amount of each, warn him that he should eat a vegetable next.
#    If Cookie has eaten more cookies than vegetables, tell him to get back on his diet. 
#    If Cookie has eaten some vegetables and NO cookies, give him a special congratulations.
#    If Cookie has eaten no vegetables and no cookies, encourage him to eat something - preferrably a vegetable.
